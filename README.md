# Veronica's Portfolio 👋

Hi, I’m **Veronica** — a beginner learning front-end development at **Noroff**.  
I started my coding journey recently, and this space is where I practice, make mistakes, learn, and slowly get better.

I enjoy building small web pages, exploring how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work, and understanding how everything connects on the front end.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning Right Now

- HTML — writing clean and clear structure  
- CSS — layouts, spacing, colors, responsive basics  
- JavaScript — simple interactions and problem solving  
- How to read errors, debug, and think like a developer  
- Git & GitHub — pushing, pulling, version control basics  

I’m very new, but I enjoy learning step by step.
